# PrimesPubSubEX
Prime Numbers Generator instructions:

Create a prime number "service" that emits the next prime number on every second (starting from 1 until a certain limit the user chooses).
Create 3 "clients": 
1. Mersenne - needs to know when a new prime number is out there and check whether it's a Mersenne number. If it is, it'll print that out.
2. Prime1 - when a prime number ends with 1, prints it with red color
3. prime4Digits - If a prime number is 4 digits, print the subtraction of it from 10,000 (like if prime number is 9973, then print 27)
